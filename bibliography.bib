  month = {February},
  abstract = {<p>This paper proposes a solution to the problem of browser-based
	fingerprinting. An important observation is that making fingerprints
	non-deterministic also makes them hard to link across subsequent
	web site visits. Our key insight is that when it comes to web tracking,
	the real problem with fingerprinting is not uniqueness of a fingerprint,
	it is linkability, i.e. the ability to connect the same fingerprint
	across multiple visits. In PriVaricator we use the power of randomization
	to "break" linkability by exploring a space of parameterized randomization
	policies. We evaluate our techniques in terms of being able to prevent
	fingerprinting and also in terms of not breaking existing (benign)
	sites. The best of our randomization policies renders all the fingerprinters
	we tested ineffective, while causing minimal damage on a set of 1,000
	Alexa sites on which we tested, with no noticeable performance overhead.</p>},
